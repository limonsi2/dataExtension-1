      "description": "A New Diva's Christmas Carol: Directed by Rusty Cundieff. With Ashanti, Mckenzie Small, Vivica A. Fox, Robin Givens. Aphrodite was made famous back in the day for performing \"the\" timeless love song of the era. The song that everyone plays at their weddings, in every sappy commercial for diamonds or rings or puppies or soldiers coming home. It made her a ton of money, but Aphrodite \"hates\" this song. She's now the meanest judge on Pop The Question but her life changes when Brianna becomes the breakthrough contestant, exuding love and purity. When Aphrodite reluctantly becomes her mentor, she does everything possible to steer her away from love and love anthems. Due to Aphrodite's sour attitude, Aphrodite is visited by three spirits who take Aphrodite on a journey through love and Christmas past, present and future to try and shake her out of her funk and let love back in.",

Three women who have been friends since childhood are enjoying their monthly dinner party when one announces to the other two, \"Together we make up the perfect woman -- you're the brains, you're the personality, and I'M the beauty!\" The others are devastated. How could she say such a thing? Six months later the three are each facing defining moments in their lives. One is struggling to be more than simply \"the beauty\" and failing miserably. Another faces a career change and extracurricular explorations. And the third faces a complete change in lifestyle as she prepares to have a baby -- alone. Trials ensue, but ultimately the three women are able to define themselves and their friendship beyond a one-dimensional view of beauty, brains, and personality. The three realize that though they may be just fine on their own, they are stronger, braver, and happier together.",

Despite being one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest's films and therefore a cinema masterpiece, 'A Clockwork Orange' was banned by Spain's Franco government, a fascist dictatorship that had ruled the country for over 35 years after a cruel civil war. The film's visuals clashed head-on with the regime's strict moral codes and censors who wished to clamp down on any subversive ideas entering Spain. Surprisingly, however, the film premiered uncensored at a long-running religious film festival, the Seminci in Valladolid, located in one of Spain's most conservative cities. How could something like this even occur? This documentary, in which Malcolm McDowell (main character in A Clockwork Orange) collaborates, aims to take the audience on an adventure that answers that very question, but also poses an even greater one: can a movie change the world?",

      "description": "Hood River: Directed by Steven Cantor, With Jonathan Field. In a small Oregon community, a high school soccer team struggles to overcome class and racial divide in a quest for both individual and team success. While Domingo deals with the deportation of his father to Mexico, and Eric painfully learns how to become a captain and command the respect of his Mexican-American teammates, Coach Riviera struggles to keep the team together amidst the pressure of academics and athletics. This coming-of-age feature documentary focuses on the friendship and maturation of three characters and is set against the backdrop of a segregated American town. Will Domingo graduate? Will Eric become a leader? Will the Eagles win a state championship?",
